# svelte app

Code was copied from [here](https://v3.svelte.technology/repl?version=3.0.0-beta.28&example=media-elements)

Then the following commands were run to compile and deploy (make sure `now` is installed based on instructions below):
1. `npm run build`
2. `now public -n svelte-app`
3. app is live at [https://svelte-app.ejolly.now.sh/](https://svelte-app.ejolly.now.sh/)

## Instructions

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.technology) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npm install -g degit # you only need to do this once

degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.


## Deploying to the web

### With [now](https://zeit.co/now)

Install `now` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g now
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
now
```

As an alternative, use the [Now desktop client](https://zeit.co/download) and simply drag the unzipped project folder to the taskbar icon.

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
npm run build
surge public
```
